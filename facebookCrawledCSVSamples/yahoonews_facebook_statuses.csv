Dozier reform school for boys in Marianna, Florida. Kimmerle led a team of researchers to unearth remains of two children from the grounds, and plans to exhume 50 graves. The state-run reform school opened in 1900 and closed in 2011 for budget reasons, though allegations of rape, torture, beating and murder of child inmates were nearly constant through its history. Child remains will be examined and DNA-tested to try to determine who was buried there and why they died. Formerly called the Florida School for Boys, it was once the largest juvenile reform institute in the United States, intended for 13 to 21-year-olds, though the two bodies found are thought to be as young as 10. The school has had a long and disgraceful history; Dr. Kimmerle said she became interested in the investigation because no records were kept of who died and were buried there, highly unusual for a state institution.

Gamblers and gangsters get them to improve their business dealings or luck. Others receive the tattoo -- done by sharp knitting-needle sized spikes dipped in magical ink, one hammered point at a time -- to help make a life transition. The script is in ancient Khmer, or Khom, and is made up of prayers and often, the signature of the artist, a Buddhist monk or trained practitioner. Photographer David Longstreath recorded one of the more famous sacred tattoo festivals in the world at the Wat Bang Phra temple in Thailand, and tells the story of what he saw. Westerners, such as Angelina Jolie and jazz singer Melody Gardot, are wearers of sacred Buddhist tattoos, though the Thai government has recently considered banning tourists from getting them, because they are not meant to be worn as fashion statements.

Last week, the House of Representatives voted by a razor-thin margin to allow this practice to continue. The vote aptly reflects Americans' polarized response to revelations about the NSA's activities. Half the country is incensed by the secret spying. The other half, however, appears to have heeded Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's now-famous advice to ""just calm down and understand that this isn't anything that is brand new."" Among this latter group, there is a sense that privacy advocates are making much ado about nothing.

Hundreds of thousands have taken to the streets in major cities, from the capital in Brasilia to Sao Paulo and Rio, in protest -- at first, against increases in public transportation costs and against the price of hosting the World Cup in 2014. Since then, though, demonstrations have expressed dismay over poor infrastructure, crime and corruption. As in Turkey, police reacted violently, shooting teargas into crowds in Sao Paulo as demonstrators complained television networks were ignoring what was really going on.

These three liligers, all female, were born in May at the zoo in Novosibirsk, Russia's third-largest city. Their mother, Zita, was born at the zoo in 2004; father Sam is an African lion. Ligers occur, at least in this time in history, only in captivity, since the habitats of these animals no longer cross in the wild. Ligers inherit behaviors from both species -- like tigers, they like to swim, and like lions, tend to be sociable. And as evidenced by the birth of these cats, ligers can reproduce. They are not sterile like other species hybrids.

In this wide-ranging interview, which talks about President Obama's drone and counterterrorism policies, Scahill reveals he became close to the family of Anwar Al-Awlaki (pictured), the U.S. citizen killed during an American drone strike in Yemen in 2011, and whose teenage son was killed shortly after. Scahill says he found al-Awlaki ""reprehensible,"" but that his family did not raise him to preach violent jihad and did not subscribe to his beliefs. Scahill, who has reported from Yemen, Afghanistan and Somalia, says he thinks the Guantanamo Bay prison should be a symbol of shame to Americans. Though no ideological soulmate to conservatives, Scahill says he admires Rand Paul's filibuster on the nomination of John Brennan to the CIA directorship as a sincere act--in contrast to the majority of Republicans, he says, who don't ""give a rat's ass to what happened to Anwar al-Awlaki,"" and take a racist view of Obama and Muslims. U.S. counterterrorism policy, he says, may be creating new terrorists abroad and may spawn more domestic terrorist acts, but in reality the U.S. is expending too much energy and resources on a relatively minor threat.

As the journalists gathered samples in syringes, tubes and baggies, a minibus full of fighters exposed to the gas arrived at one of the medical centers, Le Monde reported. The doctor who treated them was overcome by sarin. A Le Monde photographer fell sick as well. France and Britain both announced Tuesday they confirmed that sarin--a clear, colorless and tasteless liquid developed as a pesticide in Germany in 1938, according to the U.S. CDC--has been used in the Syrian war.
