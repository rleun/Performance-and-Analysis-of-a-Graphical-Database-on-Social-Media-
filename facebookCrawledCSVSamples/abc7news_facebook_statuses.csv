A Santa Cruz father sent his son's toy train into space and now the video is a YouTube hit, with over 2.6 millions views in just one week. 

Ron Fugelseth attached his 4-year-old son Jayden's toy train to a weather balloon along with an HD camera and GPS. It traveled 18 miles up into the sky before the balloon burst and ""Stanley"" came tumbling down.  The toy was recovered 27 miles away in a corn field.  The entire journey was captured on video and edited by Fugelseth, who is the creative director for a Bay Area production company.
